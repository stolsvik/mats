 * Package contains a set of abstract classes which contain common code utilized by both

 *     <li>mats-test-junit</li>
 *     <li>mats-test-jupiter</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * These abstract classes should "never" be used directly, but rather utilized through their implementors in the above
 * mention modules.
 * <p>
 * However should one want to implement a similar approach as utilized in the aforementioned modules for a different
 * testing framework, then these classes can be extends for that purpose.
