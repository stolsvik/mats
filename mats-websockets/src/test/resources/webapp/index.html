    <h1>MatsSockets test pages</h1>
    <h2>A couple of pages that performs some different MatsSockets operations</h2>
    These pages assumes that you have the two instances of the test-app running on port 8080 and 8081, i.e. running
    the AppMain.java, which boots one ActiveMQ and two Jetty instances on these ports. Note that this is not a "model"
    of how to code with MatsSockets, as it has several features aimed at testing the actual JavaScript/Java/WebSockets
    interactions: It has a "no-op" authentication plugin. It is specially instrumented to be able to control "booting"
    of the two server instances. And other crazy stuff.
